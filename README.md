# Git dojo, using github-pages

This README is available in:
[🇨🇴](README_CO_ES.md)

To sign, **click [here](https://github.com/astounds/astounds.github.io/new/main/_data/signed)** and name the file `<username>.yaml` (replace `<username>` with your name) with the following content:

```yaml
name: <your name here (optional organization or company)>
link: <link to your profile or site>
```

Without the `<>`.

Example:
```yaml
name: Example name (Good company)
link: https://github.com/example_username
```

Don't use `<>` in this file, as well as non-ascii symbols in file name. If you're using your email as a link, prepend it with `mailto:`. If you are able to, please use your real name and add projects and affiliated organizations in parentheses.

Then **click "Propose new file"** and go through the subsequent pages to create a merge request.

Alternatively, fork and clone the repo, create the file `_data/signed/<username>.yaml` manually, then commit and submit a PR.
